# ki-do-ri
A redesign attempt of the website using react. Learning functionalities such as controlling the component loading with CSS transitions. SPA with React Routes.
There's nothing much to write in this readme. I'll just write what is necessary.

## After cloning
This repository needs node, npm, and yarn to be installed. After cloning, you can execute 'yarn install' for the dependencies. You can find the dependency list in 'package.json' file.

## Scripts
1. 'npm run start' to open development mode. Using 'webpack-dev-server' plugin.
2. 'npm run build' to compress everything for production. It drops the output in the 'dist' folder. You can copy everything under the 'dist' folder and put it on the web server.

## Testing
No testing has been made in this application. I haven't learned Jest and I believe it's not the size to have such test yet.
